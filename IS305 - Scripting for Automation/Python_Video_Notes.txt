Module Requirements:

Choose one (1) of the options below:
Modify one of the Python programs from the textbook (like the XKCD comic scraping program) to automate some task that's more useful to you (essentially, personalize it!)

Develop one of the webscraping program ideas suggested by the textbook or of your own design, using the webbrowser, requests, bs4, and/or selenium modules

For this assignment, you do not need to record your entire coding session! (I understand it may take you a couple of hours to develop your program!) For your recording, walk me through your resulting, working program. Explain how the program works and make sure to execute the program and show me it working as intended.

Make sure your code is clean and includes comments.

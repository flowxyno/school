Module Requirements:

For this assignment, choose to work with either Excel or Google Sheets. No need to demonstrate both!

Demonstrate that you are able to write a Python program that reads a spreadsheet and automates some process by reading data from more than 100 cells. You can use any spreadsheet you'd like (except the ones from our textbook). Try to personalize your example or analyze some data from a source you find interesting. (Need inspiration? Check out Kaggle.comLinks to an external site. for datasets you could use. Remember, CSV data can easily be saved as XLSX.)

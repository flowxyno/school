Module Requirements:

Compare and contrast your chosen scripting language with Python. Choose at least 3 aspects of your language to compare and contrast:

1: Syntax & Readability: are there major/obvious differences in syntax between the language? How readable do you find one language compared to the other?

# PowerShell script to list files recursively
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -Recurse
foreach ($file in $files) {
    Write-Output $file.FullName
}

# Python script to list files recursively
import os

def list_files(directory):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            print(os.path.join(root, file))

list_files("C:\\path\\to\\directory")


2: Availability of Libraries: have you found there to be more libraries & frameworks available for one language over the other?


3: Platform Compatibility: can the languages be used on multiple platforms or are they limited to specific operating systems?


6: Learning Curve: how easy is each language for beginners to pick up?

if (6 == x)

if (6 -eq x)

Be sure to use visuals (like code snippets or relevant website resources) to support your claims.

Explaining the project you chose to pursue this week. Specifically:

What process your script automates
How your script saves you time and/or effort (or saves time/effort for someone you know) - even if it's obvious
Demonstrate how your automation works
If you didn't use any reference material for your script, explicitly state so. If your script was inspired by someone else's script:
Cite the starter code or code you used as a reference developed by another programmer (i.e. show the website you obtained code from)
Explain what you had to do to modify that code for your own purposes
Explain how your script works in sufficient detail that it's obvious that you understand how it works

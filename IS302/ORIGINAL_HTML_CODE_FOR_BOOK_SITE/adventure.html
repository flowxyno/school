                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        The President's secret task force has developed an unprecedented defensive 
                        weapon that relies on an extremely rare radioactive element--and Dirk Pitt 
                        has followed a twisted trail to a secret cache of the substance. Now, racing 
                        against brutal storms, Soviet spies, and a ticking clock, Pitt begins his 
                        most thrilling mission--to raise from its watery grave the shipwreck of the 
                        century...

                        This was literally the first book that I had ever read from the author Clive
                        Cussler and oddly enough it is the 4th book in the series. I really enjoyed the 
                        main character Dirk Pitt for his nothing is impossible attitude. Clive Cussler
                        books read like James Bond novels sometimes, but what fasinated me with them
                        was the combination of history (as each book starts out with something in
                        history), action and adventure, and a bit of mystery. Mr. Cussler has 4 different
                        series that he writes all pretty much spun off of the Dirk Pitt series. If you like
                        this kind of story line I highly recommend this series but I do recommend that you 
                        start at the beginning with the book The Mediteranean Caper as the books do build on
                        one another in some aspects.

                    <h2>Jurassic Park</h2>
                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>

                    <p>    
                        For me this was an awesome book. I love practically anything that has to do 
                        with dionsaurs. It also featured a dinosaur that for some reason I had never 
                        really heard of (probably because I was to enamored with the T-Rex as a kid) 
                        the Velociraptor. Plot was a bit predictable as a dinosaur zoo, for the lack 
                        of a better term, would be way too much for murphys law to pass up so naturally
                        it went down hill. Michael Crichton did an amazing job bringing to your mind the 
                        beauty, wonder and sheer imensity and terror there would be if you could 
                        interact with an extinct species such as dinosaurs. A fun piece of trivia is 
                        that the majority of Michael Crichton's books have gone to film.

                    <h2>Dracula</h2>
                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        The most famous of seductive evil in Western Literature, blood-thirsty Count 
                        Dracula has inspired countless movies, books, and plays. But, few, if any, 
                        have been fully to Bram Stoker's best-selling novel of mystery and horror, 
                        love and death, sin and redemption.<br>
                        <br>
                        Written in the form of letters and diary entries, Dracula chronicles the 
                        vampire's journey from his Transylvanian castle to the nighttime streets of 
                        London. There, he searches for the blood he needs to stay alive - the blood 
                        of strong men and beautiful women - while his enemies plot to rid the world 
                        of his frightful power.<br>
                        <br>
                        In Dracula, Stoker created a new word for terror, a new myth to feed our 
                        nightmares, and a character who will undoubtedly outlive us all.

                        No horror book page would be complete with out Dracula! Out of all the horror 
                        books that I have read (and to be honest that isn't all that many) Dracula is 
                        the most recent and also the one that I had the most pre-conceptions about. When 
                        it comes to vampires most people think Dracula so being that I grew up that way 
                        I really thought I knew the book with out ever actually reading it. I was very 
                        pleasently surprised that I really only knew the very beginning of the book and 
                        the end so everything in the middle was new to me. The writing style was way
                        different than anything I have read as it feels more like you are reading someone's 
                        journal or peeking at their letters which helped sell the old world feel of the book 
                        for me.

                    <p>
                        Welcome to Derry, Maine ...<br>
                        <br>
                        Itâ€™s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. 
                        Only in Derry the haunting is real ...<br>
                        <br>
                        They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. 
                        Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to 
                        gain success and happiness. But none of them can withstand the force that 
                        has drawn them back to Derry to face the nightmare without an end, and the 
                        evil without a name.

                    <p>    
                        It ... what to say about It, well the first time that I tried to read it I think I 
                        was a bit too young as I literally had to have a dictionary for every other paragraph. 
                        Then I tried reading it when I was like 12 I think, I still needed a dictionary but 
                        not as much. This book scared me enough that I crossed streets to get away from storm 
                        drains, didn't like clowns, and overall believed that things were out to eat me in the 
                        dark. So of course I had to see the movie with my best friend in high school which we did 
                        because neither one of us was going to say we were too scared to watch it. So this book 
                        and the following movie probably scarred my delicate young psyche so much that I had to watch
                        the new version that came out this last couple of years. Awesome book really kind of let 
                        your mind do most of the work as far as what It was and most of the time your mind is way 
                        more demented than any movie screen. Don't really recommend it for children as young as I was
                        but who knows ... see scarred :)

                    <h2>Pet Sematary</h2>
                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        When the Creeds move into a beautiful old house in rural Maine, it all seems 
                        too good to be true: physician father, beautiful wife, charming little 
                        daughter, adorable infant son - and now an idyllic home. As a family, they've 
                        got it all... right down to the friendly cat. But the nearby woods hide a 
                        blood-chilling truth - more terrifying than death itself... and hideously more 
                        powerful.

                    <p>    
                        Pet Sematary just reinforced me not being ok with any kind of graveyard 
                        because you just never know what is going to come out of it. Really well 
                        I enjoyed the book but remember saying to myself if you bury your cat in a 
                        graveyard and then it comes back to life but with a very bad disposition then 
                        why on earth would you do it again with something else, nothing good could possibly 
                        come out of that.

                    <p>
                        In the late 28th century, the Star League collapsed and the Five Successor 
                        States were born. For the last three hundred years, these mortal enemies 
                        have fought over space, land and politics, but now a new threat looms just 
                        outside the Inner Sphere. The descendants of an old Star League general - 
                        the Clans - have come to take what they believe is rightfully theirs. They 
                        have been bred into the best military force humanity has ever seen. The 
                        Clans have come to stay, and the Successor States must put aside their 
                        differences or face total destruction.<br>
                        <br>
                        LETHAL HERITAGE, volume I of the Blood of Kerensky trilogy, is the beginning 
                        of the Clan invasion in the explosive year 3030. Here the bioengineered Clan 
                        warriors make their debut. Victor Davion is a young untried prince and Phelan 
                        Kell is a bondsman of the Wolf Clan.

                        Battletech, what can I say. As a friend of mine says "you can't go wrong with
                        giant stompy mechs" and I agree with him, this book series is a definate must for
                        anyone that likes a movies like Pacific Rim and any of the Mecha genre of Anime.
                        At the time that I began reading it I really enjoyed it for, of course the giant 
                        mechs but also for the culture. The authors of this series of books took into account 
                        the different cultures of the world and alot of the star spanning "nations" in the 
                        series are modeled off of one culture or another. So for a kid growing up in a tiny 
                        town in Michigan where there wasn't really anyone that didn't look like me (if you 
                        get my meaning) this helped me understand different cultures alot easier when I finally 
                        got exposed to them. There is an actual ordered list by chronological order to read them 
                        by but I started with this book the first in the "Blood of Kerensky" trilogy and then
                        read most of the rest.

                    <h2>Expeditionary Force</h2>
                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was 
                        the good news.<br>
                        The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along 
                        the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. 
                        Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive 
                        culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by 
                        each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits.<br>
                        When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships 
                        jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary 
                        Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new 
                        allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in 
                        Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be 
                        fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, our allies are.<br>
                        I'd better start at the beginning....

                    <p>    
                        This entire series so far (because it is not all out yet) can be boiled down to the 
                        Joe and Skippy show, to give you back ground Joe is an Army Specialist who gets promoted
                        to Sergeant and then to a Colonel (hows that for working your way up the ranks) and Skippy 
                        is an ultra smart, completely full of it self elder AI that is rather absent minded and 
                        clueless in certain aspects and they are hilarious. This is a must read for those that love
                        rooting for the underdog (which is us) as they pull off some truly crazy "monkey brained" 
                        schemes to keep the more technologically advanced races from stomping the human race flat.<br>
                        <br>
                        There were a few things that pulled me into this series first was the comedy in the interaction 
                        between the main characters there are parts that make you face palm yourself and others that are 
                        nail biting suspense. Second was it felt like the author had been in the Army at some point in 
                        his life because there would be spots where situations came up and I would be like a soldier would
                        handle them like this, and weird the author had the charcter solve them pretty much exactly the 
                        way I was thinking, right down to the "mentaly challanged" (as I have to be PC here) ways of 
                        doing things so I was like this is kind of awesome. I later found out that the Author has never
                        been in the military in any branch so I am not sure where he is getting his military information 
                        but he needs to keep it up.

                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's 
                        grave. Then he joined the army.<br>
                        <br>
                        The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The 
                        bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing 
                        to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake 
                        our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been 
                        going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br>
                        <br>
                        Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the 
                        hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach 
                        retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they 
                        want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll 
                        be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at 
                        the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake 
                        of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.<br>
                        <br>
                        John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. 
                        Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he 
                        can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.

                        Finally a series whos first book is named the same as the series. There is not much to the first
                        book of this series that isn't in the synopsis above. To really be honest it was the first line
                        of the synopsis that kind of sucked me into the series, I mean who doesn't want to know how you 
                        join the Army at 75 years old. I really have enjoyed this series so far (I am still reading it), 
                        there is Action, Adventure, a little romance and even a decent amount of "your expendable and the
                        goverment is out to use you and cover it up" over shadowing for those of us that need our
                        daily dose of conspiracy.

                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        There is one final choice for the hopeless, the terminally ill, the 
                        condemned criminals, the victims who cannot be saved: becoming cyborg 
                        soldiers in the Legion. Their human bodies are destroyed and they are 
                        reborn as living weapons. But when aliens attack the Empire, the Legion 
                        must choose sides.

                        Another Series where the first book title is the same as the series. This 
                        is an awesome military sci-fi book series with an aspect that I haven't really 
                        seen in other books. Each one of the books centers around a main character that is 
                        a decendant (usually a son or daughter) of the main character in the book prior. 
                        Which for me does awesome things for continuity. Not sure I would let young readers
                        (like pre-teen) go with this series as some of the scenes can get king of graphic, 
                        though if their TV and Movie watching isn't screened at home they have probably seen
                        worse on the screen.

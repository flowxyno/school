                        Life-long friends, they went their separate ways. Now they are together again, 
                        though each holds secrets from the others in his heart. They speak of a world 
                        shadowed with rumors of war. They speak of tales with strange monsters, 
                        creatures of myth, creatures of legend. They do not speak of their secrets. 
                        Not then. Not until a chanced encounter with a beautiful, sorrowful woman who 
                        bears a magical crystal staff draws the companions deeper into the shadow 
                        forever changing their lives and shaping the fate of the world.<br>
                        <br>
                        No one expected them to be heroes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Least of all themselves.

                    <p>    
                        A friend of mine in high school recommended the Dragonlance series to me and 
                        this particular book as a starting point. This book series is definatly the 
                        perfect example of a fantasy series. A group of friends get back together after
                        years apart and then get sucked into world spanning epic adventure, sounds like 
                        the majority of the D&D campaigns I have been apart of over the years. Though 
                        this series did have a few things in it that I had not seen in books up to this
                        point (keep in mind I was reading Hardy Boys Mysteries up to this point in life
                        as I was I think 13). One thing was the depth of the character builds, these 
                        characters had background, likes, dislikes, fears and their own secrets and plot 
                        twists. The second was when one of the main charcters dies (won't say which one 
                        in case you want to read it), which I had never seen.

                    <h2>Wheel of Time</h2>
                    <p id="bs">Book Synopsis:</p>
                    <p>
                        The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become 
                        legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age 
                        that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the 
                        World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and 
                        what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.<br>
                        <br>
                        When The Two Rivers is attacked by Trollocs—a savage tribe of half-men, 
                        half-beasts— five villagers flee that night into a world they barely imagined, 
                        with new dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light.

                    <p>    
                        The Wheel of Time series was and still is in my mind best epic fantasy series 
                        I have ever read, second only probably to the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings
                        series. This series is most definatly not a light read. Spanning 14 books
                        there is an amazing ammount of depth in this series that will have you really 
                        loving some characters and really hating (like Joffrey from Game of Thrones level
                        hate) others. I can say that I identified with Rand (the primary character) off 
                        and on through out the entire series but other characters I could identify with 
                        through out. If you are looking for a series that will give you action, adventure, 
                        and excitement in a changing and evolving world background this is most definatly it.
                        I was reading this series while the books were still coming out and it was usually one 
                        a year until the later books but I would have forgotten what happened in the series so I 
                        would re-read all the prior books and then read the new one. So fun fact is I think I picked 
                        the series up when it had 4 books out so following that pattern I have read this series 10 times
                        though only once in its entirety.<br>
                        <br>
                        If I had to say one thing that was bad about the series it would be that the characters 
                        were so detailed and and backgrounds so well mapped out that there would be almost entire
                        books devoted to character development, but to me that was the only thing that would have
                        been bad<br>
                        <br>
                        Just so you are aware if you want to read the Wheel of Time series the Author Robert Jordan
                        passed away in 2007 while in the middle of writing book 12 the series was finished (rather well
                        in my opinion) by the Author Brandon Sanderson. So the series is finished but by a different
                        author.

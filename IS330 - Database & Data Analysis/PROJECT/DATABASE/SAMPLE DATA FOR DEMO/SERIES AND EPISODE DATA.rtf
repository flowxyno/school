Children of the Gods

The Stargate Program (SGC) is revived when Apophis, an alien of the same race as Ra, comes to Earth through the gate seeking hosts. After the attack, Colonel Jack O'Neill and Samantha Carter are sent to Abydos to locate, and bring back, Daniel Jackson. They all are sent to Chulak and befriend Apophis's first prime Teal'c, a Jaffa (incubator to a larval Goa'uld), who joins their side. He helps SG-1 return to Earth, though they cannot save Daniel's wife Sha're and his friend Skaara, who have been taken as hosts.

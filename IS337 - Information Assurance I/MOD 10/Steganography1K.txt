Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data to avoid detection. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making the content of a message unreadable, steganography aims to make the existence of the message undetectable. One common application of steganography involves hiding data within digital images. In this process, the original image, known as the cover image, is manipulated in such a way that the hidden data is embedded within its pixels. The human eye typically cannot discern the alterations, ensuring that the steganographic payload remains imperceptible to casual observers.

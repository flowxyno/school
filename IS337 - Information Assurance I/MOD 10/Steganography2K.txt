Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data to avoid detection. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making the content of a message unreadable, steganography aims to make the existence of the message undetectable. One common application of steganography involves hiding data within digital images. In this process, the original image, known as the cover image, is manipulated in such a way that the hidden data is embedded within its pixels. The human eye typically cannot discern the alterations, ensuring that the steganographic payload remains imperceptible to casual observers.

The process of hiding data inside image files usually involves modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of the pixels. Since these alterations are minimal, they often go unnoticed in the visual representation of the image. The sender first selects a cover image and then encodes the hidden information into the LSBs of its pixels. The choice of LSBs allows for subtle changes in pixel values without causing a significant impact on the image's appearance. The recipient, who is aware of the steganographic method used, can extract the hidden data by analyzing the LSBs of the received image. This technique provides a covert means of communication, making steganography a valuable tool in scenarios where maintaining the secrecy of the communication itself is crucial. While steganography has legitimate applications, it also poses challenges in the realm of digital forensics and security, as malicious actors may use it to hide malicious code, sensitive information, or other forms of covert communication.
